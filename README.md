# MIT-OCW-6.0001-PS5
In this problem set I use classes to create triggers that fire when a newstory published on Google or Yahoo meets certain criteria.

This project contains my work done for MIT Opencourseware's class 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, Problem Set 4. Included in addition to my code are the instructions for the problem set, a triggers.txt file containing sample triggers, a ps5_test.py file to test the code, and three other files (feedparser.py, mtTkinter.py, and project_util.py) that contain testing code. Unfortunately there is a bug (likely either caused by a change to Google's or Yahoo's RSS feed or a difference in python versions between what I'm using and what MIT was using when this course was created) that is preventing this program from fully working, however my code passes all the tests provided by MIT. I'm hoping to return to this and find the bug at some point when I have a better understanding of Python and development.
